Callouts Framework
-----------------------------------------------------
Every single callout in this project shall inherit CalloutBase instead of
directly inheriting LSPDFR Callout class.

It provides these features that shared between different callouts:
 - A spawnpoint management system
 - Name and common Police Scanner Dialogue system
 - Auto display of Response Code (Code2, Code3, etc.)
 - Blip management

-- EndSuccess()
   Reports a message of Code 4 then ends the callout.

-- OnBeforeCalloutDisplayed()
   It does the following things:
   - Manages the spawn point dedicated by the subclasses.
   - Creating callout area blip before accepting.
   - Plays the police scanner audio.

   In order to let it work, the subclass must:
   - Sets a spawn point.
   - Determines whether this call is reported by officers.
   - Sets a response code (you can also set it below).

-- OnCalloutAccepted()
   It does one thing before handing it over to LSPDFR, which is displaying the
   response code.
   Subclasses can set response code here.

-- End()
   It cleans up the blip before handing it over to LSPDFR.
